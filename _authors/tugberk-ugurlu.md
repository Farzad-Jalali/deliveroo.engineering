I'm a motivated Software Engineer with 10+ years of experience and a passion to create products 
which make an impact. I care about reliability, observability and scalibility of the 
software products I work on as much as caring about the day-to-day happiness, effectiveness, and 
productivity of the team I work as part of. 

I joined Deliveroo in January 2019 and have been working on consumer facing products since then.
