My career in web development started in 2012 as a Ruby on Rails developer. Recently, I've moved up the stack to delve further into JavaScript, and specifically React.

Outside of work, you'll find me climbing walls at Building One+ or VauxWall East.

You can also find me on Twitter as [@tomsabin](https://twitter.com/tomsabin/)
